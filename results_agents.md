Final Conclusion: After thorough interrogation and analysis:

1. **Victor_Petrov** claimed a longstanding mutual respect and friendly relationship with Sergei. He handed Sergei a drink but maintained it was a standard scotch from Sergei's own collection, intended as a friendly gesture. His alibi was uncorroborated.

2. **Elena_Rostova** provided insight into Sergei's unease regarding an old adversary and noted suspicious behavior from some old associates in the days leading up to Sergei's murder. However, she presented no substantial evidence directly linking her to Sergei's murder.

3. **Anton_Volkov** maintained an alibi confirmed by Natasha and hinted at Victor's interaction with Sergei being noteworthy. He pointed towards Victor handing Sergei the drink, which appeared friendly but needed detailed scrutiny from Natasha for subtle nuances.

4. **Natasha** confirmed that the handover of the drink by Victor to Sergei seemed casual and friendly but suggested a deeper look into Victor's behavior.

Given the accounts, Victor handling the drink, and no direct contradictions to implicate anyone else:

**Victor_Petrov is the murderer! Case closed! TERMINATE.**
